# MRI2FE

Patient-specific Finite Element Model Generation from medical imaging data

## Introduction

This package provides workflows for the generation of finite element (FE) models of the human head from patient-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance elastography data.  The objective of this toolkit is to provide fast and accurate generation of finite element head models (FEHMs) for a variety of physics and multi-physics analyses.  This package leverages industry standard tools including Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) for MRI transformation and segmentation [@tustison2021antsx;@KLEINRegistration], and the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) for meshing [@cgalmain;@cgal3d].
