# MRI2FE

Workflows for automated FE head model generation from MRI/MRE data

## Overview

This package provides tools for the generation of patient-specific finite element (FE) models of the head and brain.  This package currently supports integration of structural data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as material data from magnetic resonance elastography (MRE).
